# Self-Driving Car Specialization
This repository contains all the programming assignments from UofT/CourseEra Self-driving Car specialization

### Course 1: Introduction to Self-Driving Cars

These are assignments from the first course in the specialization, they mainly consisted of fundamental controls concepts commonly used in all vehicle models.

- Kinematic Bicycle Model: In this assignment we were tasked to create the kinematic bicycle model which is commonly used to simulate simplified vehicle car dynamics
- Longitudinal Vehicle Model: This assignment consisted of creating a longitudinal vehicle model that simulates the forward kinematics of a vehicle and updates the linear vehicle states along with the throttle based on different dynamic forces acting on the vehicle.
